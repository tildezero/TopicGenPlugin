# Topic Generator Plugin

## Description
Really simple powercord plugin that pulls a random topic from [Conversation Starters](https://www.conversationstarters.com/random.php)

## Credits
Credit goes to [ravy](https://ravy.xyz) from [The Aero Team](https://aero.bot) / YAGPDB.xyz for the original command, I just implemented it in powercord

Original command source: [Aero](https://ravy.dev/aero/aero/-/blob/master/src/commands/Fun/topic.js) | [YAGPDB](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb/blob/master/stdcommands/topic/topic.go)

## How to use
[p] is your powercord prefix

`[p]topic` - sends a topic as a private response

`[p]topic --send` - sends a topic publicly
